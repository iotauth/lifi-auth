when I make my app for controlling multiple picos I should remember that CMD: <commands> can control the pico sender and receiver, so if I was to drag and drop a file that had that string CMD: <some command>:
	an outsider would be able to trigger a command if somehow sent or loaded message into pico to send over lifi (clear key) disrupting communication
	or a user could accidentally pass a file with that and unintentionally halt operations.

Therefore I would need to add a chcek with the app that will allow me to drag and drop files to send to whichever selected picos that are available to the busses
	this would deny or alter the message slightly (or disable the CMD: <command> feature during transmission of file or message over lifi) -maybe boolean
  I would need to keep this in mind in case I run into those issues in the future

Some to:do's
- include image of hardware with pointers to what everything is in my project
- look into PRNG seeding and how to maximize entropy for randomness (harder for hackers to get me)
- add TPM for pi 4 and/or best secure caching techniques and protocols for both sender and receiver (pico and pi 4)
- use my CMD: <commands> functions to control cache and keys in real time (already implemnented)

So I think the most important/next feature could be to add the caching security on pico and pi 4. 

Once that is done look into making the entropy best I can for PRNG seeding (use temp, photodiode) etc. look into that next
